A set of tools for cadastral drafting for Autodesk AutoCAD

## List of avaliable commands
| Command Name | Description |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| INVERSECL | Displays inverse information between two points in the command window. Displays bearing, distance, delta X, delta Y, delta Z and slope % values. |
| INVERSEOS | Displays same information as the INVERSECL command but displays on the screen using transient graphics. |
| INVERSECHOS | Displays inverse information along a base line specified by two points at perpendicular offsets. |
| PTDISTANCEONLINE | Create points on a base line between two specified points. New points are created using a typed distance. Elevation is interploated using the Z value of the specified points. |
| PTINTFOURPTS | Creates a point at the intersection of four points. |
| PTBETWEENPTS | Creates a point between two specified points. |
| PTOFFSETBETWEENPTS | Creates a point between two specified points at an offset from the base line. |
| PTINTANGLEDISTANCE | Creates a point at the intersection of a bearing and a distance. User can pick which intersection point to use from the two possible calculations. |
| PTINTDISTANCES | Creates a point at the intersection of two distances. User can pick which intersection point to use from the two possible calculations. |
| PTINTANGLES | Creates a point at the intersection of two bearings. |
| PTANGLEDISTANCE | Creates a point at a bearing and distance. |
| PTOFFSETLINE | Creates a point at an offset from a found intersection. |
| PTPRODOFLINEDIST | Creates a point on the production of a line at a specified distance. |
